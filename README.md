# drupal8-multipath

This is a clean Drupal 8.3.1 website with 3 modules added in the sites/all/modules
- PURL https://www.drupal.org/project/purl which is also patched, to make it work on install.
- Ctools, dependency of PURL
- Domains rewrites dynamicaly, small module with admin form for settings, and which initialises a Dynamic Provider for PURL.

Documentation and the issue is on it's way very soon.
